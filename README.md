# Predictive Modeling with Time Series Data

This project is based on an academic machine learning assignment and has been
reframed to highlight business-oriented analytical thinking and model evaluation.

## Problem
How can we build reliable predictive models using historical data while avoiding
data leakage and ensuring stable performance on future observations?

## Data
- Multivariate time series dataset
- 12 years of daily observations
- Numerical and categorical features
- Strong seasonality and temporal patterns

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using scikit-learn pipelines
- Time-based train, validation, and holdout split
- Comparison of multiple regression and machine learning models
- Hyperparameter tuning with time-series cross-validation

## Key Insights
- Preprocessing choices had a larger impact on performance than model selection
- Ensemble models consistently outperformed simpler approaches
- Gradient Boosting achieved the best balance between accuracy and generalization
- Proper time-aware validation was critical to avoid overly optimistic results

## Tools
Python · pandas · NumPy · scikit-learn · Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project focuses on analytical reasoning and decision-making rather than
academic reporting.
